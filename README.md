### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Hongchen Xue (è–›å¼˜è¾°). You can call me Hongchen.

ðŸŒ± I am currently a second-year graduate student (expected to graduate in 2025) at ADA@SUDA, advised by Prof. An Liu. Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2018-2022, Computer Science and Technology) from NJUPT.
